I am Yuqing (Chelsea) Wu, a first-year CS PhD student at the **University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)**, currently advised by Professor Elena Zheleva. I am currently in my first-year rotation period.

I graduated from the **University of Chicago (UChicago)** with an MS in Applied Data Science and a 4.0/4.0 GPA.

I have spent over two years in research on RL, LLM-based modeling, network-driven behavior analysis.

I spent over five years in industry building NLP/LLM systems, optimization-driven recommendation models, and production AI-agent workflows.

I am currently **seeking more research opportunities (especially in summer)** and collaborations aligned with my research interests.

## Research Interests

- Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision-Making
- Causal Inference and Causal RL
- Large Language Models, NLP, and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Machine Learning Optimization and Decision-Focused Learning
- Network and Social Computing
- Trustworthy and Reliable ML (generalization, open-world settings)

## Current Work

I study stance dynamics in French election social-media conversations by constructing tweet-level temporal trajectories from reply/retweet parent-child links and encoding each tweet with pretrained language-model embeddings (e.g., CamemBERT/XLM-R). I then build a dynamic causal DAG over time to represent how historical context and exposure relate to subsequent stance signals, enabling counterfactual analysis and a causal-RL style sequential framing.

My current analysis combines LLM-derived stance signals, time-aware causal RL modeling, and network-aware controls for latent homophily to evaluate how observed switching differs from what we would expect under counterfactual exposure histories.

## Past Experience

#### Research

- **University of Illinois Chicago** (Jan 2026-Present): Studying causal peer effects and stance dynamics in French election social-media data, with focus on peer exposure, reinforcement, and backfire patterns.
- **Northwestern University** (May 2025-Dec 2025): Used network structure with LLM/NLP representations to quantify novelty and identify emerging research gaps.
- **Greaten AI** (Dec 2024-May 2025): Studied dynamic communication topology for multi-agent LLM systems, including actor-critic style policy optimization (A2C-style) for adaptive coordination.
- **University of Chicago, UChicago Medicine, Department of Surgery** (Jan 2024-Feb 2025): Analyzed links among air pollution exposure, microbiome patterns, and metabolic biomarkers with causal and statistical modeling.

#### Work

- **OOIN Media, AI Agent Engineer** (Aug 2025-Jan 2026): Built LLM-driven AI-agent workflows for business automation and creator collaboration pipelines.
- **Hillhouse Capital, Senior Machine Learning Engineer** (May 2022-Jul 2023): Shipped recommendation and optimization systems that improved conversion in production.
- **DiDi, Senior Machine Learning Engineer** (Sep 2020-May 2022): Built uplift-modeling and constrained optimization pipelines for campaign allocation and user growth.
- **FinUp, Model Analyst** (Jan 2018-Sep 2020): Developed credit risk and fraud modeling pipelines for lending decisions.
