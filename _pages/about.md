I am **Yuqing Wu (Chelsea)**, a first-semester PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), advised by **Elena Zheleva**.

Before starting my PhD in January 2026, I spent over five years in industry building NLP/LLM systems, optimization-driven recommendation models, and production AI-agent workflows.

I am currently seeking first-year rotation opportunities and collaborations aligned with my research interests.

## Research Interests

- Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision-Making
- Causal Inference and Causal RL
- Large Language Models, NLP, and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Machine Learning Optimization and Decision-Focused Learning
- Network and Social Computing
- Trustworthy and Reliable ML (generalization, open-world settings)

## Current Work

I am currently studying stance dynamics in French election social-media interactions, focusing on whether repeated direct peer exposure reinforces prior positions or triggers backfire effects.

My current analysis uses time-aware causal comparisons with network-aware controls for latent homophily, combined with LLM-derived stance signals, to compare observed switching behavior against plausible counterfactual patterns.

## Past Work Experience

- **SDE-AI Agent Engineer**, OOIN Media (Aug 2025-Jan 2026): Built multi-agent automation pipelines for end-to-end merchant-creator collaboration workflows.
- **Software Development Engineer**, Greaten AI (Dec 2024-May 2025): Built adaptive LLM multi-agent topology selection systems (AMAS) for complex task coordination.
- **Senior Machine Learning Engineer**, Hillhouse Capital (May 2022-Jul 2023): Shipped recommendation modeling and optimization systems that improved conversion in production.
- **Senior Machine Learning Engineer**, DiDi (Sep 2020-May 2022): Built uplift-modeling and constrained optimization pipelines for campaign allocation and user growth.
- **Model Analyst**, FinUp (Jan 2018-Sep 2020): Developed credit risk and fraud modeling pipelines for loan decision support.
