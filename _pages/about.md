I am Yuqing Wu (Chelsea), a first-semester PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), currently advised by Elena Zheleva.

I graduated from the University of Chicago (UChicago) with an MS in Applied Data Science and a 4.0/4.0 GPA.

I have spent over two years in research on causal learning, network-driven behavior analysis, and LLM-based modeling.

I spent over five years in industry building NLP/LLM systems, optimization-driven recommendation models, and production AI-agent workflows.

I am currently seeking more research opportunities (especially in summer) and collaborations aligned with my research interests.

## Research Interests

- Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision-Making
- Causal Inference and Causal RL
- Large Language Models, NLP, and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Machine Learning Optimization and Decision-Focused Learning
- Network and Social Computing
- Trustworthy and Reliable ML (generalization, open-world settings)

## Current Work

I am currently studying stance dynamics in French election social-media interactions, focusing on whether repeated direct peer exposure reinforces prior positions or triggers backfire effects.

My current analysis uses time-aware causal comparisons with network-aware controls for latent homophily, combined with LLM-derived stance signals, to compare observed switching behavior against plausible counterfactual patterns.

## Past Experience

### Research Experience

- **University of Chicago, Biomedicine Department** (Jan 2024-Feb 2025): Analyzed links among air pollution exposure, microbiome patterns, and metabolic biomarkers with causal and statistical modeling.
- **Greaten AI** (Oct 2024-May 2025): Studied dynamic communication topology for multi-agent LLM systems, including actor-critic style policy optimization (A2C-style) for adaptive coordination.
- **Northwestern University** (May 2025-Dec 2025): Used network structure with LLM/NLP representations to quantify novelty and identify emerging research gaps.

### Work Experience

- **ALLINMEDIA, AI Agent Engineer** (Aug 2025-Jan 2026): Built LLM-driven AI-agent workflows for business automation and creator collaboration pipelines.
- **Hillhouse Capital, Senior Machine Learning Engineer** (May 2022-Jul 2023): Shipped recommendation and optimization systems that improved conversion in production.
- **DiDi, Senior Machine Learning Engineer** (Sep 2020-May 2022): Built uplift-modeling and constrained optimization pipelines for campaign allocation and user growth.
- **FinUp, Model Analyst** (Jan 2018-Sep 2020): Developed credit risk and fraud modeling pipelines for lending decisions.
